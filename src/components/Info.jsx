                <p>All Sadboys Gear orders are shipped from Borås, Sweden via UPS Worldwide.

                    Shipping rates are determined by weight, destination, and how fast you want to receive your package at point of purchase.

                    To find out the cost of shipping for your order, add the items you want into your shopping cart and proceed to checkout until you’ve selected your shipping method. The cost of shipping will automatically update in your order total before you need to enter your payment method information.

                    Once your order has been shipped, you will receive an email confirmation of your shipping details and tracking number.

                    For all destinations outside of the EU, customers may face import and duty taxes. These vary from country to country and Sadboys Gear has no control over them. In the event that you need to pay import and duty taxes, you will be contacted directly by the shipping service and the order will not be released until you have paid. Please contact your local customs office for further details of charges.

                    In the case that UPS is unable to deliver a package due to an incorrect address entered by the customer, multiple failed attempts to reach the customer by phone number (required at purchase) at point of delivery or otherwise, Sadboys Gear is not responsible for payment of return shipping costs levied by the courier.

                    Similarly, Sadboys Gear is not responsible for the payment of re-shipping merchandise to the customer. In cases such as these, the customer is responsible for all shipping costs associated with returned packages due to failed delivery.

                    Sadboys Gear is not responsible for unexpected shipping delays caused by circumstances such as severe weather or natural disasters. Similarly, we are not responsible for unexpected shipping delays caused by circumstances related to the courier itself, such as clearance delays. Similarly, Sadboys Gear is not responsible for theft of packages.

                    In cases such as these, please contact your courier with any inquiries about the status of your package.
